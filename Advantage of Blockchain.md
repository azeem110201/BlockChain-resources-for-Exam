## Advantages of Blockchain

Blockchain technology has become popular because of the following.

- Time reduction: In the financial industry, blockchain can allow the quicker settlement of trades. It does not take a lengthy process for verification, settlement, and clearance.
- Unchangeable transactions: Blockchain only allows insertion of data, which means when a new block is added to the chain of ledgers, it cannot be removed or modified.
- Reliability: Blockchain certifies and verifies the identities of each interested parties. This removes double records, reducing rates and accelerates transactions.
- Security: Blockchain uses very advanced cryptography to make sure that the information is locked inside the blockchain. It uses Distributed Ledger Technology where each party holds a copy of the original chain, so the system remains operative, even the large number of other nodes fall.
- Decentralized: It is because there is no central authority supervising anything. There are standards rules on how every node exchanges the blockchain information.
